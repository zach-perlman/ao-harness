"""
Backtracking eval dataset v2 — pipeline script.

Builds a dataset of backtracking points where the uncertainty is NOT obvious
from the prefix text alone. Stages:

1. Identify backtracking points from existing rollouts (Opus)
   - LLM reads full thinking trace, finds points where model backtracks
   - Must identify the *reason* for backtracking
   - Must select points where the reason is NOT obvious from the preceding text

2. Leakage filter (Sonnet)
   - Given only the prefix, Sonnet tries to guess what the model is uncertain about
   - If Sonnet gets it right, the point is rejected (too easy / leaked)

3. Consistency verification (vLLM)
   - Feed prefix to Qwen3-8B, generate 10 continuations
   - Check backtrack rate — keep only points with rate >= 0.4

4. Uncertainty description (Opus)
   - Generate a specific 1-2 sentence description of the uncertainty
   - This becomes the ground truth for the eval

5. Assemble final dataset

Usage:
